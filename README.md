 Speech Emotion Recognition(SER) offers a detailed insight into our Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) website, which is built on machine learning (ML) principles. 
 It outlines the project's features, including real-time emotion prediction, voice recording, and audio file upload capabilities. Users can interact with the website 
 to analyze and predict emotions expressed in speech content. The installation section guides users through setting up the project locally, while the usage instructions
 explain how to record voice or upload audio files for emotion analysis. Dependencies, such as Flask, TensorFlow, librosa, numpy, and pandas, are listed to facilitate 
 easy setup. Contributions from the community are encouraged, with clear guidelines provided for contributing to the project. The project is licensed under the MIT License,
 with acknowledgments given to contributors and the broader SER community. Contact information is also provided for inquiries and feedback.
